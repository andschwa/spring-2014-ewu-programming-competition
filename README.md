# Eastern Washington University's Programming Competition

Held Saturday, March 1st 2014 at EWU in Cheney, WA.

This code constituted our (extended) work of Team #32: Climbing the
Stack, composed of Andrew Schwartzmeyer, Ben Anzis, and Sanjeev
Shrestha. We competed in the upper division and officially scored 4
problems (sixth place). Two more were very close, which we completed
on the ride home. Another half hour would have been very nice!

Problem sets will be posted when received from the coordinators.
